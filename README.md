**An Example of Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining on stackoverflow survey dataset**

<h2>1.Business Understanding</h2> 

**Business Understanding** is related to tackling and understanding the problems and questions that needs to be answered based on specific domain, some of the examples are mentioned below 

i.How do we acquire new customers?

ii.Does a new treatment perform better than an existing treatment?

iii.How can we improve communication?

iv.How can we improve travel?

v.How can we better retain information?

<h2>2.Data Understanding</h2>

At this step the data is collected based on the Business Understanding, all the business questions will be moved to the data and those business questions will be analyzed based on the data collected.


<h2>3.Data Preparation</h2>

**Data preparation** helps in preparing the data which helps to answer the **questions of interest** that were framed , this includes Data wrangling and cleaning which usually takes 80% of the total data analysis process.

4.Data Modelling

**Data Modelling** involves instantiating a predictive model in order to answer some of the business questions like predicting the salary of an employee , predicting the jobsatisfaction.
But most of the times **descriptive statistics and inferential statistics** do provide substantial amount of solution to most of the business questions.

**Questions that can be solved using descriptive and a little inferential staticstics are:** [How to break into the field](https://github.com/chaithanya21/CRISP-DM/blob/master/How%20To%20Break%20Into%20the%20Field.ipynb) and [What are the placement and salaries of those who attended a coding bootcamp?](https://github.com/chaithanya21/CRISP-DM/blob/master/Job%20Satisfaction.ipynb) 

**Questions that can be solved using predictive modelling are:** [How well can we predict an individual's salary? What aspects correlate well to salary?](https://github.com/chaithanya21/CRISP-DM/blob/master/Putting%20It%20All%20Together.ipynb) and [How well can we predict an individual's job satisfaction? What aspects correlate well to job satisfaction?](https://github.com/chaithanya21/CRISP-DM/blob/master/Putting%20It%20All%20Together.ipynb)
